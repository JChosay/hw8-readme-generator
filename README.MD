### 1. Description

This application punches users in the face when they violate one of several conditions. These include: entering an incorrect password; trying to enter too many characters in an input field (or too few); shaking the computer in any way, shape, or form; and on and on. In addition, each user is assigned a random index number based on computer ID (stored in local storage with a key of 'randPunch'. This will result in a randomly-selected, additional face-punch trigger. Woe unto our users; their pain will fuel our 401(k)s, and their tears will fill our bank accounts up with sweet, sweet cheddar.

### 2. Installation

This application is web-deployed; users need not install anything.

### 3. Usage

You may use this software only if you are not a complete jibroni. If you don't understand what I mean by that, then you are included and may not use it.

Ohio State fans are similarly barred from usage, as are in fact most Ohio residents.

### 4. License

### 5. Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are forbidden. If you try it, we will send people to your house to pulverize your lawn, let the air out of your kid's bike tires, and insult your spouse in grossly personal terms. You were warned.

### 6. Tests
Extensive testing has been done to ensure that this application works as intended; whaddya' think we are, crooks?
